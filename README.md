## About Me
<img align="right" alt="A drawing in anime style of a hand typing on a keyboard, showing a Gundam on the screen" src="./laptop.gif" width="200" height="185" />
âœ¨ I'm a web developer with 5 years of experience, specializing in PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia. I also have expertise in Node.js, Docker, and other technologies. Throughout my career, I've worked with both SQL and NoSQL databases, always emphasizing best practices and architectures like TDD, RESTful APIs, and SOLID principles.

Over the years, I've developed new applications, resolved critical technical issues, addressed client demands and feedback, maintained and updated legacy systems, and implemented new features.

My experience includes working in environments with multiple databases, managing complex API integrations, and building high-performance, secure applications, particularly those involving financial information.

I've collaborated with various teams, from full-stack developers to more traditional setups with tech leads, managers, and QAs, usually following agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban. I've contributed to teams through code reviews, creating educational content, and standardizing processes.

When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking out about 3D printing or roleplaying games. Both my work and hobbies revolve around building thingsâ€”whether it's websites, systems, gadgets, stories, or characters.

- âš¡ **Fun fact:** Most of my English skills came from video games, Gundam anime with English subtitles, TV series, and basic English classes at a Brazilian school. Despite the unorthodox learning methods, I've been certified multiple times in advanced English.
